SMART SIGNAL JUMPING PENALTY RAISING AND VEHICLE TRACKING SYSTEM

India being a second largely populated country ,holds a large number of vehicles.
As the number of vehicles are increasing day by day the number of traffic violations are increasing resulting in accidents.
One such traffic violation present day is traffic signal jumping .
Many accidents were the result of traffic jumping.And now a days we can find vehicles on the Zebra-crossing when the red signal is turned on and resulting no path for pedestrians to  cross the road .
Now Here I and my team come up with a solution for this two main issues using Internet Of Things Technology.This project not only solves the problem and it has additional benefits of smart challans , vehicle tracking.
Benefits of this project:
* Usage of cctv cameras can be avoided.
* this works 24/7.
* Quickest penalty raising.
Project Details:
This project mainly works on RFID readers and RFID Tags using ADRUINO/NODEMCU
